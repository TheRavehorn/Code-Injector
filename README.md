# Code-Injector
Simple Linux Code-Injector by Ravehorn. Built using my library -> https://github.com/TheRavehorn/SNFQ-SimpleNetFilterQueueLibrary. In order to use it you must configure your own ARP-Spoofer, or just use my ARP-Spoofer -> https://github.com/TheRavehorn/ARP-Spoofer before running File-Interceptor. Run -> sudo python main.py
